im thinking of ways that the player could have influence in general. songs seems like a nice way to do it cause then you have a system that can identify a fairly unique input in a way that has direct emotional 

connection with the player. like if theres an injured person, you could lay them to rest peacefully. or maybe you could play another song to trap their soul, and get a powerful item. or smaller things. like a song of

growing to grow certain plants. or just a normal song that someone would recognize. songs for fast travel. just ocarina of time like. i just want it to have some uses that tie into literally changing the outcome of the story.
